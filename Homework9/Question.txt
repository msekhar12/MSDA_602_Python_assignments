Use the pandas module to answer the following questions about the EPA-HTTP data set.  Print the result of each part to the console.  Use pandas as much as you can; this includes the data structure and the analysis.
•Which hostname or IP address made the most requests?
•Which hostname or IP address received the most total bytes from the server?  How many bytes did it receive? 
•During what hour was the server the busiest in terms of requests?  (You can do this by grouping each hour period e.g. 13:00 – 14:00. Then count the number of requests in each hour)
•Which .gif image was downloaded the most during the day?
•What HTTP reply codes were sent other than 200?

Use any other tools or techniques you need to create an efficient program.  These include scipy, numpy, regex, Tkinter, etc.
