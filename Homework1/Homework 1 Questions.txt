Homework 1

Your first homework assignment will be a quick and easy jump into Python.  For this and next week's assignments, I will supply a basic template that you need to expand upon.  Attached is a file hw1_template.py.  

Do all of the following:
1.Download and install Python 2.7.x on your computer.
2.Fill in the 4 functions in hw1_template.py.  I want to be able to run the main function and see correct values printed from the function calls.

The functions are:
不ortwithloops.  Take the input list and return a sorted list, do not use list functions.  Do this just looping through the values.  Use any kind of sort you wish.
不ortwithoutloops: Take the input list and return a sorted list, use list functions.
不earchwithloops: Takes two inputs, the list and a value to search for.  Returns true if the value is in the list, otherwise false.  Do not use list functions.  Do this just looping through, with any kind of search.
不earchwithoutloops: Takes two inputs, the list and a value to search for.  Returns true if the value is in the list, otherwise false.  Use list functions.
3.Submit by attaching the completed .py file to your submission.  I will run "python hw1.py" (or whatever you call it) to see if your solution is correct.

This and the next assignment should be pretty easy.  This helps me do a quick assessment on the class before we move forward.  If you have a lot of trouble with these assignments, please let me know.
