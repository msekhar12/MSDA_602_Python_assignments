Homework 6 
.


With this assignment, we'll take a look at some of what the numpy module can do.  

Do both of the following:
1.Using your submission of homework 1 as a base, replace as many of the functions as you can with numpy functions.  For example, instead of using your sort function that you wrote, use numpy.sort.  Refer to here for most of the functions you'll need.   
2.Using the timeit function measure the execution times of all the sort and search functions you have.  You'll most likely need to do a large number of tests on each one to get a meaningful result.  Something like 10000 or more.  

Your submission will be a single file that has all the functions from homework 1 and the additional approach using numpy.  Additionally, you will have the timing of all the functions output to the console. Something like.
•Sort using iteration:  x loops = y seconds
•Sort using built in python: x' loops = y' seconds
•Sort using numpy: x'' loops  = y''seconds

You fill in all the values for x and y.
