What we are doing here is very similar to homework 6, but now we'll look a bit at scipy.

Do parts 1 and 2.  Part 3 is optional
•Take what you did on homework 5 as a starting point (using any of the provided datasets).  Replace the regression calculation using least squares with a curve fitting approach (examples in the reading).  To start, just fit a linear equation.  Output the equation to the console.  You don't need to graph anything (we'll look at that in a couple more weeks).
•Again, using timeit, compare the performance of your solution in homework 5 to the scipy function.  Output the results to the console.
•(Optional)  There are other models that can be fitted to the data we have.  Try to fit other equations, like Gaussian, to the data.  Output the equation to the console.
